how you write something 

    Semantics 

Type Checking 

    Evaluation 

Variable Bindings 

    type check expression and extend static enviroment
    Evaluate expression and extend dynamic enviroment

ML if condition syntax  

    Syntax 

    if e1 then e2 else e3

    where if then are keywords and e1, e2, and e3 are keywords and e1, e2, and e3 are subexpressions

    type-checking:

    first e1 must have type bool
    e2 and e3 can have any type t but must have the same type
    the type of entire expression is t

    Tilde for negation

    / is div in ml

    cannot divide by 0

Shadowing 

Multiple variables of the same variable is often poor style

- often confusing
