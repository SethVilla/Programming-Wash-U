(* Boolean Operations 

    andalso

    or else

*)


(* Bad practice 

    if e 
    then true 
    else false

    just write e

    same as in javascript !e

    not e

    for not 

    <>
    you cannot use some comparison operators when using a real vs int
    reals are not an equality check for epsilons instead
