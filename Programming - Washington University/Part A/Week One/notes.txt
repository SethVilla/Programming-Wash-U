REPL 

A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user;

C x C c quit emacs
C g cancel action
C x C s save file
C x C f find 
C 

C w cut a highlighted region 
C k cut from the cursor to the end of the line
C y paste yank 

C-x 2: Split the window into 2 buffers, one above the other (Use the mouse or C-x o to switch between them)
C-x 0: Undo window-splitting so there is only 1 buffer
C-x b: Switch to another buffer by entering its name
C-x C-b: See a list of all current buffers
